	\item[\tt Scientific Software Engineer] at ORNL 
	\hfill {\tt Mar 2023 - present}
		\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item design, build, test, and document code base for neutron scattering data reduction
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
		\underline{Technology}: 
		C++17; python [pydantic, pytest, pyqt, mantid]; ubuntu linux; agile [scrum].
	% ANCHORAGE DIGITAL

	\hfill {\tt Oct 2022 - Mar 2023}
		\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item analyze cryptocurrency market liquidity
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
		\underline{Technology}: 
		python [pandas, gsheets]; Google Cloud; BigQuery.
		% why did I leave: the FTX disaster caused a huge slowdown in the cryptocurrency market, 
		% and I suspected there would soon be layoffs.  Indeed, they laid off about 20% of the staff
		% including my entire department a week after I left
	% COMMUNITY.COM
	\item[\tt R\&D Data Scientist] at \href{https://www.community.com/about-us}{Community} 
	\hfill {\tt Sep 2021 - Jun 2022}
		\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item analyze big data for product insights using causal inference and market archetyping%
			%\item work on team with data engineering to transform databases for data lakehouse [dbt]
			%\item ownership of platform NLP microservices for SMS tagging
			%\item present key findings to stakeholders in product and finance
		\end{itemize}
		\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}
		\underline{Technology}: 
		python [pandas, numpy, sklearn, spaCy]; github; Snowflake SQL; Docker; AWS.
		% why did I leave: the CEO had planned the budget with a deal that suddenly evaporated
		% during the post-covid market crash.  Over a third of the staff were laid off.
	% UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA

		%\end{itemize}
		% why did I leave: these were two contracts for two summer terms, offered to grad students.  
		% I was invited back for a third, but wanted another student to have the opportunity.
