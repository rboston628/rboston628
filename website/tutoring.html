    <h1>Tutoring by Dr. Boston</h1>
    <h2> Qualifications </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>PhD in Physics from UNC, 2022</li>
      <li>Adjunt professor of physics at UNC, for summer terms 2019, 2020</li>
      <li>High school STEM teacher at Mount Pisgah in Johns Creek, GA, 2015-2016</li>
      <li>Over a decade of experience with tutoring</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Experience </h2>
    <p>
      I started tutoring math and physics at Georgia College in 2009, and have been tutoring regularly since then.
      I have tutored students at GC, at UGA, and at UNC.  Courses have included:
    </p><ul>
      <li>all levels of physics</li>
      <li>engineering physics, in special scale-up/studio format</li>
      <li>all college math, especially calculus and statistics</li>
    </ul><p>
      Physics is a hard subject.
      It is hard firstly because students struggle to see its relevance,
      but it is also hard because <b>our natural intuition will often lead us astray</b>.
    </p><p>In my many years working 
      directly with students, I know the sort of "intuitive" shortcuts that students want to take that will 
      lead to incorrect answers.  I can spot these errors before you make them, then offer correction, not only 
      on what is correct, but <i>why</i> the error <i>seemed</i> correct.
    </p><p>
      In my experience, the most useful thing for student success on exams is modeling complete problem solutions. 
      Even if a student knows the conceptual material, it is very difficult to put all of the steps together for a 
      complete solution without having seen the process modeled by an expert.
    </p>
    <h2> Tutoring</h2>
    <p>My rate this semester is <b>$50/hr</b>.</p>
    <p>I can meet <b>in-person</b> for students in the Knoxville area.  This is the most effective format.</p>
    <p>I can also meet <b>virtually</b>. I suggest you have a tablet and electronic pencil for virtual meetings.</p>
    <h3> UTK Courses </h3>
    <p>I can help with math or physics at any level.  Below are some example courses.</p>
    <table style="border: 1px solid black;">
      <tbody>
        <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">PHYS 231</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Intro Physics I</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">EF 151</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Engineering Physics</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">KNS 372</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Biomechanics</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Before contacting me, please attend your professor's office hours, and try the free peer tutoring provided by UTK.</p>
    <h3> High School </h3>
      <p>I can help with any high school calculus or physics course, but especially the following:</p>
      <table style="border: 1px solid black;">
      <tbody>
        <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">AP Physics C</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Mechanics</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">AP Physics C</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">E&M</td></tr>
        <tr><td style="border: 1px solid black;">AP Physics 1</td><td style="border: 1px solid black;">Mechanics</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>I would not be very helpful for algebra, geometry, trig, or pre-calculus; nor other science courses.</p>
