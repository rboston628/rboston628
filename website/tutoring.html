    <h2> Experience </h2>
    <p>
      I started tutoring math and physics at Georgia College in 2009, and have been tutoring regularly since then.
      I have tutored students at GC, at UGA, and at UNC.  Courses have included:
    </p><ul>
      <li>all levels of physics</li>
      <li>engineering physics, in special scale-up/studio format</li>
      <li>all college math, especially calculus and statistics</li>
    </ul><p>
      Physics is a hard subject.
      It is hard firstly because students struggle to see its relevance,
      but it is also hard because <b>our natural intuition will often lead us astray</b>.
    </p><p>In my many years working 
      directly with students, I know the sort of "intuitive" shortcuts that students want to take that will 
      lead to incorrect answers.  I can spot these errors before you them, then offer correction, not only 
      on what is correct, but <i>why</i> the error <i>seemed</i> correct.
