# Reece Boston

I am an astrophysicist, focusing in particular on relativistic white dwarf asteroseismology.

I am employed full-time as a data scientist for Community, an innovative SMS platform allowing for personal conversations at scale.  I utilize statistics, machine learning, and natural language processing to help our customers achieve this goal.

My PhD in Physics was earned from the University of North Carolina in April, 2022.  I also attended the University of Georgia (MS Physics, 2015).  My undergraduate degree in Mathematics is from Georgia College (2010).

## about me

I am from Atlanta, GA, and currently live in North Carolina with my wife, Nelly.  We are expecting our first child in August.  In my spare time I study physics, read fiction, and play old school dungeons and dragons.

I am an adept programmer in C++, which is my preference for any production applications.  My two main coding projects for my research were both written entirely in C++.  This language was chosen because of its speed and control.  I deliberately use low-level constructs whenever possible.

I also have experience programming in R, python, SQL, x86, Objective-C and Java.  In python, I have worked with pandas, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels, flask, spaCy, and of course numpy and matplotlib.

## research interests

- general relativistic stellar structure and linear pulsations
- computer modeling of compact objects (neutron stars, white dwarfs)
- Bayesian and bootstrap methods in statistics
- causal inference modeling

## bullet points

- [My dissertation](https://github.com/rboston628/THESIS) is not yet available online, but will be linked when it is.

- [My CV](https://github.com/rboston628/rboston628/blob/master/BostonReeceCV2022.pdf) is available here in GitHub.

- [My resume](https://github.com/rboston628/rboston628/blob/master/rboston_resume.pdf) is also available.

### research code

My dissertation research required two codes to model the pulsations of white dwarf stars.

- [GRPulse](https://github.com/rboston628/GRPulse) uses simple models, working in Newtonian, Post-Newtonian, and General Relativistic frameworks
- [THRAIN](https://github.com/rboston628/THRAIN) creates realistic WD models in Newtonian physics.
