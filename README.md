I am a PhD candidate at UNC, studying relativistic astrophysics.  [My university website](https://reeceboston.web.unc.edu).

[My CV](https://github.com/rboston628/rboston628/blob/master/BostonReeceCV2020.pdf) is available here in GitHub.

My main research project has been the creation of [GRPulse](https://github.com/rboston628/GRPulse), for studying the Newtonian and General Relativistic pulsations of white dwarf stars.
