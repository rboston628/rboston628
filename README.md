# Reece Boston

I am an astrophysicist, focusing in particular on relativistic white dwarf asteroseismology.

My PhD in Physics was earned from the University of North Carolina in April, 2022.  I also attended the University of Georgia (MS Physics, 2015).  My undergraduate degree in Mathematics is from Georgia College (2010).

I am employed full-time as a Scientific Software Engineer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), in particular working on the SNAPRed and mantid programs for the Spallation Neutron Source.

## technical summary

I am an adept programmer in C++, which is my preference for any production applications.  My two main coding projects for my research were both written entirely in C++. 

Additionally I have worked extensively with python on a number of projects.  In particular, I have worked with pandas, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels, FastAPI, spaCy, and of course numpy and matplotlib.

## research interests

- general relativistic stellar structure and linear pulsations
- computer modeling of compact objects (neutron stars, white dwarfs)

## bullet points

- [My dissertation](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/jw827n44n?locale=en) on white dwarf asteroseismology.

- [My CV](https://github.com/rboston628/rboston628/blob/master/BostonReeceCV2022.pdf) intended for academic positions can be accessed here.

- [My resume](https://github.com/rboston628/rboston628/blob/master/rboston_resume.pdf) intended for technical roles can be accessed here.

### research code

My dissertation research required two codes to model the pulsations of white dwarf stars.

- [GRPulse](https://github.com/rboston628/GRPulse) uses simple models, working in Newtonian, Post-Newtonian, and General Relativistic frameworks
- [THRAIN](https://github.com/rboston628/THRAIN) creates realistic WD models in Newtonian physics.

## about me

I am from Atlanta, GA, and live in Tennessee with my wife Nelly and our son Ezekiel.  In my spare time I study physics, read fiction, and play old school dungeons and dragons.  I write a blog that was temporarily famous in 2012-2015 for its post about the Berenst#in Bears.
