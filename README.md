# Reece Boston

I am a scientific software engineer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), in particular working on the SNAPRed and mantid programs for the Spallation Neutron Source.

My PhD in Physics was earned from the University of North Carolina in April, 2022. My research focused in particular on computational models in relativistic white dwarf asteroseismology.  I also attended the University of Georgia (MS Physics, 2015).  My undergraduate degree in Mathematics is from Georgia College (2010).

## technical summary

I have been programming in C/C++ since around 2012.  My two main coding projects for my research were both written using in C++.  I am familiar with low-level C++98 methods, as well as more modern language features in the standard library. 
I have recently begun working at ORNL with the [mantid](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid) codebase.

Additionally I have worked extensively with python on a number of projects.  Currently I am part of the team building [SNAPRed](https://github.com/neutrons/SNAPRed) for neutron scattering data reduction at ORNL.  I have also worked with pandas, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels, FastAPI, spaCy, numpy and matplotlib during my time as a data scientist.

## research interests

- general relativistic stellar structure and linear pulsations
- computer modeling of compact objects (neutron stars, white dwarfs)

## bullet points

### research code

My dissertation research required two codes to model the pulsations of white dwarf stars.

- [GRPulse](https://github.com/rboston628/GRPulse) uses simple models, working in Newtonian, Post-Newtonian, and General Relativistic frameworks.
- [THRAIN](https://github.com/rboston628/THRAIN) creates realistic WD models in Newtonian physics.

## about me

I am from Atlanta, GA, and live in Tennessee with my wife Nelly and our son Ezekiel.  In my spare time I study physics, read fiction, and play old school dungeons and dragons (see my [WIP game rules](https://rboston628.github.io/brigandine/)).  I write a blog that was temporarily famous in 2012-2015 for its post about the Berenst#in Bears.
