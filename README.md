I am an astrophysicist, focusing in particular on relativistic white dwarf asteroseismology.  [My dissertation](https://github.com/rboston628/THESIS).

[My CV](https://github.com/rboston628/rboston628/blob/master/BostonReeceCV2022.pdf) is available here in GitHub.

[My resume](https://github.com/rboston628/rboston628/blob/master/rboston_resume.pdf) is also available.

My main research project has been the creation of [GRPulse](https://github.com/rboston628/GRPulse), for studying the Newtonian and General Relativistic pulsations of white dwarf stars.  I am still awaiting the publication of my paper discussing the code results before releasing it.  Please contact me by email for a pre-publication release.
